# T1A3-Terminal-Application
## Software Development Plan 

#### R5: Develop a statement of purpose and scope for your application. It must include:

##### describe at a high level what the application will do
The terminal application created will be a productivity buddy. The main feature of the terminal application will a clock and/or timer. The user will set the timer for any time interval required, for example 35 minutes. The user will input the time intervals in which the clock will check in with the user. These check in's, will be a variety of incrustations to the user such as: “stretch your neck and shoulders” “you’re on the right track.” 

#### identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
##### The problem that will be addressed through this application: 

-  1: Keeping productivity on track can be difficult: often when you’re working on a solution or studying for long perid of time, work begins to lose focus and distractions begin to infiltrate workflow. The timer is intended to host a productive work environment. 

-  2: Optimise focus and concentration: the application will achieve this by, the user working through short period of time with positive affirmation and good workflow habbits. 

-  3: Reduce workload anxiety:
 by working efficiently, and slowly completing tasks with purpose, the individual will feel that the task despite being difficult, it’s it always achievable. 

-  4: identify the target audience:
The target audience will be anybody with a task. Students working on their software, teams managing group assignment. The app footprint is for a variety of users across different industries and purposes. 

##### explain how a member of the target audience will use it
Target audience: tech student working on an assignment. The student will select their timeframe, select their check in intervals and begin their work. For groupwork: the team will repeat the steps above for optimum focus and group workflow.

#### R6	Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
Menu 
- describe each feature
Menu: The application will have a menu, which will be the first point of naviagtion for the user. The menu will direct the user to select from timer options (Individual or group)


Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling

Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient .

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#### R7	Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
Your outline must include:
- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

#### R8	Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:
- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.
_______________________________________________________________________________

#### R10 Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application
gems: Timers 4.3.3, Colorize 0.8.1, tty-prompt 0.23.1
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements


_____________________________________________________________________________________
#### R17	Design TWO tests which check that the application is running as expected.

Each test should:
- cover a different feature of the application
- state what is being tested
- provide at least TWO test cases and the expected results for each test case

> An outline of the testing procedure and cases should be included with the source code of the application
