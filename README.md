# T1A3-Terminal-Application
## Software Development Plan 

#### R4 GitHub Repository 

https://github.com/droucode/T1A3-Terminal-Application- 

#### R5: Develop a statement of purpose and scope for your application. It must include:


##### describe at a high level what the application will do
My terminal application will serve as productivity buddy, for the user. The purose of the application is to encourage  positive work habits and create an en enviroment where that is possible.

The MVP for Crunch-Time is as follows: 

- 1. The user has the option to run two programs "Energy" and "Mindfulness", which are run on a timer. The routines are created to serve different user needs.
- 2. Alarm?
- 3. Reflection .txt file 

#### identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
##### The problem that will be addressed through this application: 

Working productively is an life essential skill to develop apon. Often when youâ€™re working on a solution or studying for long perid of time, work begins to lose focus and distractions begin to infiltrate workflow. Problems and outcomes are listed below: 
 
- 1. Decrease distractions: By optimising focus and concentration. Both routines are designed to enourage the user to connect with their body, clear their mind and discover the intention of their task. 

- 2. Reduce workload anxiety and stress: By working efficiently and slowly completing tasks with purpose, the individual doesnt lose sight of the task being achievable. 

- 3. Promote healthy habits: Exercising and practcing mindfulness are important components to a healthy and balanced lifestyle. 

- 4. Identify the target audience:
The target audience will be anybody with a task. Students working on project/ teams managing group assignment/ work tasks. The applicaton has a large footprint, for a variety of users across different industries and purposes. 

##### explain how a member of the target audience will use it
Example Target Audience: Group assignment, it's important to remember that everybody works diferently; Each team member will select their prefered program "Energy"/"Mindfulness" or both and run the routine. Once everybody has reflected and aquired their focus and intention, colaboration and begin. (Alarm)

#### R6	Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- At least THREE features
- Menu 
- Energy Routine
- Mindfulness Routine
- Reflective .txt file 
- Alarm 

- Describe each feature
Menu: The main menu is first point of naviagtion for the user and is responisble for the control flow of the application. The menu is build using the TTY-Prompt gem and will encompace a while loop.  

Energy: 

Mindfulness:

Reflective .txt file 


Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#### R7	Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
Your outline must include:
- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
The user is initially greeted with a heading "Welcome". 


- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

#### R8	Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:
- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.
_______________________________________________________________________________

#### R10 Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application
gems: Timers 4.3.3, Colorize 0.8.1, tty-prompt 0.23.1
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements


_____________________________________________________________________________________
#### R17	Design TWO tests which check that the application is running as expected.

Each test should:
- cover a different feature of the application
- state what is being tested
- provide at least TWO test cases and the expected results for each test case

> An outline of the testing procedure and cases should be included with the source code of the application
